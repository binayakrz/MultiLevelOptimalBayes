Title: Regularized Bayesian Regression for Small-Sample Two-Level Latent Variable Models
Version: 0.0.1.0
Description: MultiLevelOptimalBayes is an R package tailored for researchers, 
    particularly in psychology and education, who encounter challenges in 
    estimating between-group effects in two-level latent variable models 
    with small sample sizes. This package offers a regularized Bayesian 
    approach to between-group parameter estimation that minimizes the 
    Mean Squared Error (MSE) of the estimated parameter, incorporating 
    both variance and bias considerations. It provides more reliable estimates 
    in scenarios characterized by limited data availability.
